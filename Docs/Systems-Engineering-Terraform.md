**Systems Engineering Approach:**

- **Requirements Definition:** Define the requirements for your infrastructure, such as scalability, reliability, and security.
- **Design:** Use Terraform to design your infrastructure, breaking it down into modules and components.
- **Implementation:** Write Terraform code to implement your design. Use version control to manage changes.
- **Verification and Validation:** Test your infrastructure configurations using tools like Terratest to ensure they meet the defined requirements.
- **Deployment:** Use Terraform to deploy your infrastructure in a controlled and automated manner.
- **Operations and Maintenance:** Continuously monitor and update your infrastructure using Terraform, ensuring it adapts to changing requirements and environments.
