1. **Define Infrastructure:**
    
    - Write Terraform configuration files (.tf) to define your infrastructure components, such as VPCs, subnets, instances, and security groups.
2. **Initialize Terraform:**
    
    - Run `terraform init` to initialize your Terraform environment and download necessary provider plugins.
3. **Plan Changes:**
    
    - Run `terraform plan` to generate an execution plan. This shows what changes Terraform will make to achieve the desired state.
4. **Apply Changes:**
    
    - Run `terraform apply` to execute the plan and provision the infrastructure.
5. **Monitor and Update:**
    
    - Continuously monitor your infrastructure. When changes are needed, update the Terraform configuration and reapply.
