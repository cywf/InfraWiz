**Feedback Loop and Automation:**

- **Monitoring and Feedback:** Integrate monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to gather real-time data about your infrastructure. Use this data to make informed decisions about scaling and maintenance.
- **Automation:** Use Terraform in conjunction with CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions) to automate infrastructure updates based on monitoring data.
- **Self-Healing:** Implement automated recovery mechanisms using Terraform. For example, if a server goes down, Terraform can automatically replace it to maintain the desired state.
